// Mutation self-test for the "Breaking-change footers survive the squash" job
// in .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml.
//
// That guard is a shell script embedded in YAML. actionlint checks its syntax,
// zizmor checks the workflow around it, and until this file nothing ever RAN
// it — so a regex edit, a lost `set -euo pipefail`, or a silently renamed job
// would leave the check reporting green over a script that had stopped
// deciding anything. It sits beside the audit-gate test here for the same
// reason that one exists: a gate nobody exercises is a gate nobody can tell
// has broken.
//
// It is reachable only because `scripts/**/*.test.ts` is in vitest.config.ts's
// `include` — that glob is an explicit override of vitest's default, so a test
// added outside src/ without a matching entry is silently never executed. A
// self-test that does not run is worse than none, because the workflow comment
// then names a proof nobody performs.
//
// HOW. The `run:` block is EXTRACTED from the committed workflow rather than
// copied into this file. A copy would drift from the thing it claims to prove,
// which is the same defect one level up. `gh` is stubbed with a script that
// prints a fixture commit history, so no network and no repository are
// involved.
//
// The `gh-unavailable` case is the one that pins fail-closed behaviour, and it
// is the only case a lost `set -euo pipefail` fails. Without that line the
// failed `gh api` still creates an empty commits.ndjson through the redirect,
// the loop counts nothing, and the job prints "Breaking-change declarations in
// this PR: 0" and exits 0 — a check that has stopped looking, and
// indistinguishable from a clean pull request. Every other case here runs
// against a `gh` that succeeds, so none of them can see it.
