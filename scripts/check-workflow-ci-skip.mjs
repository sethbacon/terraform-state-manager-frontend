/**
 * Reject CI-skip directives in workflow and composite-action files.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `translate.yml` shipped `commit-message: "chore(i18n): update translations [skip ci]"`
 * from the day it was written. GitHub honours the skip directive on the HEAD COMMIT of a
 * branch for BOTH `push` and `pull_request` events, so every PR that workflow opened was
 * born with zero check runs and zero commit statuses -- not red, not pending, absent.
 * Branch protection showed "Expected - waiting for status" forever and twelve of those PRs
 * were merged by admin override without a single gate ever executing.
 *
 * The head commit of a `create-pull-request` branch never changes, so the suppression is
 * permanent for the life of the PR.
 *
 * HOW THIS SCANS -- TWO PASSES, NEITHER SUFFICIENT ALONE
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * The first version of this guard matched the RAW SOURCE TEXT only. That is not enough,
 * because YAML has more than one spelling for the same string. All four of these parse to
 * exactly `chore(i18n): update translations [skip ci]` and all four defeated a source-text
 * regex:
 *
 *   commit-message: "... [skip\x20ci]"       <- hex escape for the space
 *   commit-message: "... [skip\u0020ci]"     <- unicode escape for the space
 *   commit-message: "... \x5Bskip ci]"       <- hex escape for the opening bracket
 *   commit-message: "... [skip \<newline>ci]" <- double-quoted line continuation
 *
 * The fourth is the instructive one. A whitespace-normalising whole-file pass was believed
 * to close the multi-line axis; it closes the `>-` folded scalar only. A line continuation
 * leaves a literal backslash between the words, which survives normalisation and breaks
 * `\s+`. Chasing spellings one at a time is unwinnable -- there is always a fifth.
 *
 * So the load-bearing pass is PASS 2: parse the YAML and test the RESOLVED STRING VALUES,
 * which is what GitHub itself reads. Every present and future spelling of the same string
 * collapses to one value, and one comparison covers them all.
 *
 * PASS 1 (raw text) is kept, because it is not a subset of pass 2:
 *
 *   - Comments are absent from parsed YAML. A directive in a comment is harmless today but
 *     is one uncomment away from live, and a guard that cannot see it has a blind axis.
 *   - A file that fails to parse still gets read.
 *
 * PASS 2 is not a subset of pass 1 either: it sees through escapes, continuations and folds.
 * A directive has to evade BOTH to land. The union is the guard.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT: a directive assembled at runtime -- `commit-message: "x ${{ env.MSG }}"` --
 * is invisible to any static scan, in either pass. That case is covered by the runtime
 * auditor in scripts/assert-pr-checks-present.mjs, which observes the PR after it exists.
